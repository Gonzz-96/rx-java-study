# RxJava Study Notes

I created this series of notes while reading the book *Learning RxJava* by Thomas Nield. Feel free to clone this project, study it, or even create PR's if I'm missing something or you know some mysterious RxJava tricks. Hope this will be useful for anyone who is studying RxJava.

### Index
* **Chapter** 1: Thinking reactively
